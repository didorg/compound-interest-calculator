## Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct to foster an open and welcoming environment.

### Our Pledge
We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

### Our Standards
- Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focus on what is best for the community.
- Show empathy toward other community members.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, trolling, or other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers privately. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
