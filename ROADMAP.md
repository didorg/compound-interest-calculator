## Roadmap

This roadmap outlines likely next steps and larger ideas. Priorities may shift based on community feedback.

### Short Term
- Wire up compounding frequency (monthly/quarterly) in `calculations.ts`
- Add unit tests for `calculateCompoundInterest`
- Persist form state in URL or localStorage

### Medium Term
- Currency/locale selector and formatting
- Export data (CSV) and chart (PNG)
- Add explanatory tooltips and docs for formulas

### Long Term
- Multiple scenarios comparison (e.g., side-by-side)
- Advanced assumptions (inflation, fees, tax)
- Mobile PWA packaging
